# Advent of Code

This is my single repository for all advent of code work going forward.


All scripts work in basically the same way:


Run Day 1, Part A of 2023 in Python.
```bash
cd python
python main.py 2023 1 a
```

Run Day 5, Part B of 2023 in Rust.
```bash
cd rust
cargo run 2023 5 b
```

Of course in Go, no operation -- however simple -- could be done so concisely. Instead:
```bash
cd go
go run ./cmd/advent/main.go 2023 8 b
```
